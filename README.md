# Sweet Shop Management System

This repository contains the design and partial implementation plan
for a Sweet Shop Management System built using TDD principles.

## Project Status (Important)
Due to time constraints, this submission focuses on:
- Complete API design
- Auth & authorization model
- Test-driven development plan
- Realistic commit strategy

The implementation was planned to include:
- Backend REST API with JWT authentication
- Frontend SPA for users and admins
- Database-backed persistence
- Automated test suite

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, NestJS, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Auth: JWT
- Testing: Jest, Supertest

## API Overview
See `docs/API_SCHEMA.md`

## Authentication Model
See `docs/AUTH_MODEL.md`

## TDD Test Plan
See `docs/TDD_TESTS.md`

## Commit Strategy
See `docs/COMMIT_PLAN.md`

## My AI Usage
I used ChatGPT to:
- Design API endpoints
- Define the authentication and authorization model
- Draft a TDD-oriented test plan
- Structure commit history strategy

All outputs were reviewed and adapted manually.
